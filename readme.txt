= What is PageSlurp? =

PageSlurp is the technology that we invented to provide a secure and PCI compliant way for us to run your WordPress them on our secure servers so that all your secure pages look just like the rest of your website. Basically, we invented an easy, one-click way to let you skin your secure pages with your WordPress theme.

= What is PCI compliance? =

PCI Compliance is a set of requirements that your business needs to meet in order to accept credit card payments. If you are using Cart66 Cloud for your e-commerce, then your website is PCI compliant. If you are not using Cart66 Cloud then you need to handle all of the PCI requirements on your own. Becoming PCI compliant on your own is very expensive and challenging. For more information about PCI compliance, see [What you need to know about PCI compliance](http://cart66.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-pci-compliance/ "PCI Compliance").
